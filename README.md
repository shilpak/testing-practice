## This project has multiple goals:

* Practice writing unit tests
* Determining what is a valid test and what is not based on javadoc commentary and reading code
* Simple testing experience; finding creative ways to break code and find bugs
* Experience documenting bugs and missing functionality via failing unit tests


We'll start with a single class and method `com.shilpak.testingpractice.stringtools.Palindrome.isPalindrome(boolean)` and its unit test class `com.shilpak.testingpractice.stringtools.PalindromeTest`.  I've written a single positive (happy path) test in the test class to get you started.


This is a very basic Maven project.  The unit tests can be run using the command `$ mvn test`.



#### What are Shilpa's responsibilities?

* Write as many unit tests as you can think of.  There are a lot to write.  Be creative.  Break things.
* This project has lots of bugs and missing a lot of functionality.  Find as many bugs and missing or incorrect functionality as you can based on the javadocs for the method and the method's code itself.  I expect to see positive (happy path) as well as negative tests.
* DO NOT FIX BUGS!  Instead write a failing unit test which demonstrates the incorrect behavior, push your changes, and send me a message.  I'll fix any bugs we find.



#### What are Tracey's responsibilities?

Fix any bugs and give guidance on unit tests.
